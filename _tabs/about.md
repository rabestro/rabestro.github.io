# About Me

Hello! I'm Jegors, a Software Engineer with a diverse background in various technologies and a passion for learning and teaching.

## Work Experience

Currently, I'm working at EPAM System as a Software Engineer, where I'm involved in the development of an internal training platform and support of a business-critical application with high SLA. I use technologies like SAP BTP, CloudFundry (Azure, AWS), Java, Groovy, JUnit, Spring Boot, Bash, Apache jMeter, PowerShell, PowerQuery M, and PowerBI.

You can read their testimonials [here](https://exercism.org/profiles/rabestro/testimonials). I've also authored several exercises for the AWK track, including ["Mazy Mice"](https://exercism.org/tracks/awk/exercises/mazy-mice) and ["Automated readability index"](https://exercism.org/tracks/awk/exercises/automated-readability-index).
