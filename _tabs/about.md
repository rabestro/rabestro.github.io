Hello! I'm Jegors, a Software Engineer driven by a passion for creating robust solutions and empowering the next generation of developers through education and mentorship.

## Passion for Open Source & Education

I am deeply involved in the open-source education platform [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/profiles/rabestro), where I serve as an official **maintainer** for the **Scala** and **AWK** language tracks. In this role, I help shape the curriculum, review contributions, and guide fellow developers.

As an active mentor for **Java, Scala, Python, Bash, and AWK**, I find it incredibly rewarding to help students overcome challenges and master new technologies. The most meaningful part of this work is seeing them succeed. I'm grateful to have received over one hundred testimonials from students I've mentored, which you can read on my [Exercism public profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/rabestro/testimonials).

## Professional Experience

Currently, I am a Software Engineer at [**Evolution**](https://www.evolution.com/). My work is focused on a challenging project at the intersection of **AI and image recognition**, primarily using **Scala** and **Python**.

Previously, at EPAM Systems, I was involved in developing an internal training platform and supporting a business-critical application with a high SLA, utilizing technologies like SAP BTP, Java, Spring Boot, and various cloud services.

## Skills & Core Technologies

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not coding, I enjoy strategic challenges like Dice Chess. In 2024, I was thrilled to participate in the [3rd Latvian Dice Chess Championship](https://dicechess.net/3rd-latvian-dice-chess-championship-how-it-went/ "null"), an experience that was both challenging and incredibly fun.
