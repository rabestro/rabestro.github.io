```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤– To create unit tests for the `getSum` method, I need more information about the problem statement and the expected behavior of the method. Please provide a detailed description of the problem, including any constraints and examples.

ðŸ‘¤ Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5

Constraints:

    -1000 <= a, b <= 1000



ðŸ¤– Thank you for providing the problem statement. Based on the given information, I will suggest the following test cases for black box testing:

Test Case 1: Normal case
- Input: a = 1, b = 2
- Expected Output: 3

Test Case 2: Normal case
- Input: a = 2, b = 3
- Expected Output: 5

Test Case 3: Edge case - minimum values
- Input: a = -1000, b = -1000
- Expected Output: -2000

Test Case 4: Edge case - maximum values
- Input: a = 1000, b = 1000
- Expected Output: 2000

Test Case 5: Edge case - zero values
- Input: a = 0, b = 0
- Expected Output: 0

Test Case 6: Edge case - negative and positive values
- Input: a = -500, b = 500
- Expected Output: 0

Please confirm if these test cases are good to proceed with generating the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ add cases where one value is zero and other negative or positive

ðŸ¤– Sure, I have added two more test cases as per your request:

Test Case 7: Edge case - one value is zero and the other is positive
- Input: a = 0, b = 5
- Expected Output: 5

Test Case 8: Edge case - one value is zero and the other is negative
- Input: a = 0, b = -5
- Expected Output: -5

Please confirm if these test cases are good to proceed with generating the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ add cases where b = 0

ðŸ¤– I have added two more test cases where b = 0:

Test Case 9: Edge case - one value is positive and the other is zero
- Input: a = 5, b = 0
- Expected Output: 5

Test Case 10: Edge case - one value is negative and the other is zero
- Input: a = -5, b = 0
- Expected Output: -5

Please confirm if these test cases are good to proceed with generating the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ nice

ðŸ¤– Great! Now I will generate the test code for the `getSum` method using the test cases we have discussed.

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.CsvSource;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

class SolutionBlackBoxC4Test {

    @DisplayName("getSum method black box testing:")
    @ParameterizedTest(name = "Test Case {index}: a = {0}, b = {1} -> Expected Output = {2}")
    @CsvSource(delimiter = '|', textBlock = """
            1  |  2  |  3
            2  |  3  |  5
            -1000  |  -1000  |  -2000
            1000  |  1000  |  2000
            0  |  0  |  0
            -500  |  500  |  0
            0  |  5  |  5
            0  |  -5  |  -5
            5  |  0  |  5
            -5  |  0  |  -5
    """)
    void getSumBlackBoxTest(int a, int b, int expectedOutput) {
        // Arrange
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Act
        int result = solution.getSum(a, b);

        // Assert
        assertThat(result).as("The sum of %d and %d should be %d", a, b, expectedOutput).isEqualTo(expectedOutput);
    }
}
```

This test code uses JUnit 5 and AssertJ for testing the `getSum` method in the `Solution` class. The test cases are parameterized using the `@CsvSource` annotation, and the test method `getSumBlackBoxTest` is provided with the input values and expected output for each test case.

ðŸ‘¤ implement solution

ðŸ¤– Here is the implementation of the `getSum` method in the `Solution` class using bitwise operations:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int carry = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = carry << 1;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

This implementation uses bitwise operations to calculate the sum of two integers without using the + and - operators. The `while` loop continues until there is no carry left. Inside the loop, the carry is calculated using the bitwise AND operation, the sum is calculated using the bitwise XOR operation, and the carry is shifted left by one position.
