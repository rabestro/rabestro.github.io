In this article, we'll explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can assist in creating unit tests using white box technology. We'll use a problem published on LeetCode as a testing object, specifically the "Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree" problem (https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/).

## Engaging with Artificial Intelligence

First, let's introduce the AI and discuss the role it plays in ensuring our script is functioning properly. We'll provide our code to the AI, and our goal is to generate unit tests that will effectively examine our solution.

## AI's Request for Information

As the AI follows the system prompt instructions, it encounters an unfamiliar class and requests more information. After reviewing the provided details, the AI proceeds to suggest different test options.

## Visualizing Test Cases

We ask the AI to present these test cases as cards and to display the corresponding graphs in the Mermaid format. As we analyze the test cases, we request the AI to include a few more options.

## Evaluating and Generating Unit Tests

The AI effectively incorporates our suggestions, resulting in a comprehensive set of test options. Our next step is generating the unit tests based on these test cases.

## Refining the Unit Tests with AI Assistance

Although the initial tests function well, we believe that they can be even more effective. We ask the AI to make some adjustments, and after a few revisions, we arrive at the final version of our improved unit tests.

In conclusion, leveraging artificial intelligence greatly benefited the process of generating and refining unit tests. With its enhanced efficiency and precision, AI proves to be an invaluable tool in ensuring the accurate functioning of our code.

## The AI Conversation Log

ðŸ‘¤ Hi, who are you?

ðŸ¤– Hello! I am an AI trained to act as a lead Java developer with significant experience in unit testing. I can help you create unit tests for your Java code, suggest test cases, and generate test code using JUnit 5 and AssertJ assertions. If you have any code snippets that need testing, feel free to share them with me, and I'll be happy to help!

ðŸ‘¤ 
```java
package leetcode.p235;

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        }
        if (p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p ,q);
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤– I see that you have provided a code snippet for finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary search tree. Before I suggest test cases and generate test code, I need to know the structure of the `TreeNode` class. Can you please provide the definition of the `TreeNode` class?

ðŸ‘¤ 
```java
package leetcode.p235;

public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode(int x) {
        val = x;
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤– Thank you for providing the `TreeNode` class definition. Now, I will analyze the problem statement and suggest test cases for the `lowestCommonAncestor` method in the `Solution` class.

1. Test case with a simple binary search tree and nodes with a common ancestor.
2. Test case with a larger binary search tree and nodes with a common ancestor.
3. Test case with a binary search tree where one of the nodes is the root.
4. Test case with a binary search tree where one of the nodes is a direct child of the other.
5. Test case with a binary search tree where the nodes have the same value.
6. Test case with a binary search tree where the root is null.

Please confirm if these test cases are good, and then I will generate the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ What techniques do you use to create these test cases?

ðŸ¤– I used the following techniques to create the test cases for the `lowestCommonAncestor` method:

1. **Edge Coverage**: This technique involves testing the boundaries of the input domain. In this case, I included a test case with a null root (test case 6).

2. **Branch Coverage**: This technique ensures that each branch in the code is executed at least once. The test cases cover all branches in the `lowestCommonAncestor` method, including cases where one of the nodes is the root (test case 3), both nodes are on the left or right subtree (test cases 1 and 2), and one node is a direct child of the other (test case 4).

3. **Condition Coverage**: This technique ensures that each condition in the code is tested with both true and false outcomes. The test cases cover all conditions in the `lowestCommonAncestor` method, such as when the root is null, when the root is equal to one of the nodes, and when both nodes are in the left or right subtree.

4. **Path Coverage**: This technique ensures that all possible paths through the code are executed. The test cases cover all possible paths in the `lowestCommonAncestor` method, including cases where the nodes have the same value (test case 5).

These techniques help ensure that the test cases provide good coverage of the code and help identify potential issues or edge cases.

ðŸ‘¤ The test cases are fine

ðŸ¤– Great! Now I will generate the test code for the `lowestCommonAncestor` method in the `Solution` class using the test cases provided. The test class will be named `SolutionWhiteBoxC4Test`.

    }

    private static Stream<Object[]> testCases() {

        testCase3.right = new TreeNode(15);
        testCase3.left.left = new TreeNode(3);
        testCase3.left.right = new TreeNode(7);
        testCase3.right.left = new TreeNode(12);
        testCase3.right.right = new TreeNode(18);

        TreeNode testCase4 = new TreeNode(8);

                new Object[]{testCase2, "Larger binary search tree, nodes with a common ancestor", testCase2.left.left, testCase2.right, testCase2},
                new Object[]{testCase3, "Binary search tree, one of the nodes is the root", testCase3, testCase3.left, testCase3},
                new Object[]{testCase4, "Binary search tree, one node is a direct child of the other", testCase4.left, testCase4.left.left, testCase4.left},
                new Object[]{testCase5, "Binary search tree, nodes have the same value", testCase5.left, testCase5.left.right, testCase5.left},

        );
    }
}
```

This test code uses JUnit 5 and AssertJ assertions. It includes a `@MethodSource` annotation to provide the test cases for the `lowestCommonAncestorTest` method. The test cases cover various scenarios, including different tree structures and node relationships.

ðŸ‘¤ The test works fine, however, I've got this message from SonarLint:
"Test assertions should include messages".

Did you follow all the requirements from my instructions?

ðŸ¤– Apologies for missing the assertion messages in the test code. I will update the test code to include messages for the assertions as per your instructions.

Here's the updated test code with assertion messages:

```java
package leetcode.p235;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.MethodSource;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@DisplayName("Solution White Box C4 Test")
class SolutionWhiteBoxC4Test {

    private final Solution solution = new Solution();

    @DisplayName("Lowest Common Ancestor Test")
    @ParameterizedTest(name = "Test case {index}: {1}")
    @MethodSource("testCases")
    void lowestCommonAncestorTest(TreeNode root, String description, TreeNode p, TreeNode q, TreeNode expectedLCA) {
        var actualLCA = solution.lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q);
        assertThat(actualLCA)
            .as("The lowest common ancestor of nodes %d and %d in the '%s' scenario should be %d", p.val, q.val, description, expectedLCA.val)
            .isEqualTo(expectedLCA);
    }

    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
}
```

I have added the `.as()` method to the `assertThat` statement to include a message describing the expected outcome for each test case. This should address the SonarLint warning and provide more informative test results.

ðŸ‘¤ for test case with null root I've got this message:
"java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field "val" because "expectedLCA" is null"

ðŸ¤– Apologies for the oversight. I will update the test code to handle the null root case properly. Here's the updated test code with the correct assertion message for the null root case:

```java
package leetcode.p235;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.MethodSource;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@DisplayName("Solution White Box C4 Test")
class SolutionWhiteBoxC4Test {

    private final Solution solution = new Solution();

    @DisplayName("Lowest Common Ancestor Test")
    @ParameterizedTest(name = "Test case {index}: {1}")
    @MethodSource("testCases")
    void lowestCommonAncestorTest(TreeNode root, String description, TreeNode p, TreeNode q, TreeNode expectedLCA) {
        var actualLCA = solution.lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q);
        if (expectedLCA == null) {
            assertThat(actualLCA)
                .as("The lowest common ancestor of nodes %d and %d in the '%s' scenario should be null", p.val, q.val, description)
                .isNull();
        } else {
            assertThat(actualLCA)
                .as("The lowest common ancestor of nodes %d and %d in the '%s' scenario should be %d", p.val, q.val, description, expectedLCA.val)
                .isEqualTo(expectedLCA);
        }
    }

    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
}
```

I have added a conditional check for the `expectedLCA` being null and used the `.isNull()` assertion in that case. This should resolve the NullPointerException issue and provide the correct assertion message for the null root test case.

ðŸ‘¤ I prefer to extract this test case in the separate test method

ðŸ¤– Sure, I will extract the test case with a null root into a separate test method. Here's the updated test code with the null root test case in a separate method:

```java
package leetcode.p235;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.MethodSource;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@DisplayName("Solution White Box C4 Test")
class SolutionWhiteBoxC4Test {

    private final Solution solution = new Solution();

    @DisplayName("Lowest Common Ancestor Test")
    @ParameterizedTest(name = "Test case {index}: {1}")
    @MethodSource("testCases")
    void lowestCommonAncestorTest(TreeNode root, String description, TreeNode p, TreeNode q, TreeNode expectedLCA) {
        var actualLCA = solution.lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q);
        assertThat(actualLCA)
            .as("The lowest common ancestor of nodes %d and %d in the '%s' scenario should be %d", p.val, q.val, description, expectedLCA.val)
            .isEqualTo(expectedLCA);
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Lowest Common Ancestor Test with Null Root")
    void lowestCommonAncestorTestWithNullRoot() {
        TreeNode root = null;
        TreeNode p = new TreeNode(1);
        TreeNode q = new TreeNode(2);
        TreeNode expectedLCA = null;

        var actualLCA = solution.lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q);
        assertThat(actualLCA)
            .as("The lowest common ancestor of nodes %d and %d with a null root should be null", p.val, q.val)
            .isNull();
    }

    private static Stream<Object[]> testCases() {
        // ... (rest of the code remains the same, but remove the null root test case from the testCases() method)
    }
}
```

I have created a separate test method called `lowestCommonAncestorTestWithNullRoot` for the null root test case and removed it from the `testCases()` method. This should make the test code more organized and easier to understand.

ðŸ‘¤ Everything is going well now. Thank you for your hard work.

ðŸ¤– You're welcome! I'm glad everything is working well now. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with your project!
