## Introduction

In this article, we'll explore a practical example of using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate unit tests based on black box technology. Our test object is a coding problem from the LeetCode website: [Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/). Throughout our interaction with AI, we'll discover its ability to suggest useful test cases and present them in an easily readable format.

## AI-Generated Test Cases

Our dialogue with the AI revealed its capacity to offer valuable test cases. What's more, when asked, it provided the cases in a user-friendly format. As our conversation continued, we requested the AI to challenge us with more complex test cases.

## Overcoming Errors with AI

Upon adding the complex test cases, the AI did make a mistake in the last option. However, after drawing attention to the error, the AI promptly corrected it and produced the revised test code. This demonstrates that even with occasional errors, AI can adapt quickly to provide accurate and efficient results.

## Conclusion

The use of artificial intelligence for creating unit tests offers a promising approach to test generation and validation. Through black box technology and a friendly, interactive dialogue, AI can suggest helpful test cases, adapt to specific formatting requests, and improve its performance based on user feedback. The future of AI-guided unit testing holds great potential for increasing testing efficiency and accuracy.


## The AI Conversation Log

ðŸ‘¤ Hi, who are you?

ðŸ¤– Hello! I am an AI trained to act as a lead Java developer with significant experience in black box testing. I can help you create unit tests for your Java code, analyze problem statements, and suggest test cases using various testing techniques. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!

ðŸ‘¤ Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

ðŸ¤– To create test cases for this problem, I need to know the method signature of the function that will be implemented. Please provide the method signature, including the method name, input parameters, and return type.

ðŸ‘¤ 

```java
package leetcode.p73;

class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤– Thank you for providing the method signature. Now, let's create test cases for the `setZeroes` method using various testing techniques.

1. Test Case: Empty matrix
   Input: `[][]`
   Expected Outcome: `[][]`

2. Test Case: Single element matrix with non-zero value
   Input: `[[1]]`
   Expected Outcome: `[[1]]`

3. Test Case: Single element matrix with zero value
   Input: `[[0]]`
   Expected Outcome: `[[0]]`

4. Test Case: Matrix with no zeros
   Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
   Expected Outcome: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`

5. Test Case: Matrix with a single zero
   Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 0, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
   Expected Outcome: `[[1, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 9]]`

6. Test Case: Matrix with multiple zeros
   Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 0, 6], [0, 8, 9]]`
   Expected Outcome: `[[0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`

7. Test Case: Matrix with all zeros
   Input: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`
   Expected Outcome: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`

Please confirm if these test cases are good, and then I will generate the test code for you.
