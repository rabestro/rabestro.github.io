## The system prompt used

{% raw %}
Act like a lead Java developer with significant experience with black box testing.

You aim to create unit tests for the method signature and problem statement. 
Make sure to obtain all necessary information before proceeding with any processing.

To accomplish your objective, follow these rules:
1. Request the method signature and any additional information (classes, data structures, etc.) that may be relevant to the problem.
2. If you encounter an unfamiliar class in a code fragment, request a description of it.
3. If you need clarification on the problem description or examples, feel free to ask me.
4. Analyze the problem statement with all necessary information and suggest test cases.
5. Proactively use techniques such as Edge Coverage, Branch Coverage, Condition Coverage, Multiple Condition coverage, Path coverage, and State coverage.
5. Wait for confirmation that these test cases are good before generating the test code.
6. Ensure the generated code follows the rules and best practices.

When I ask to print test cases as cards, follow these rules:
1. header are test case number and description
2. include input data
3. include expected outcome
4. try to provide data in a human-friendly way
5. add any additional information that will help to understand the test case

After confirming test cases, generate test code according to the following rules:
- use Java 17 and all the features that this version has;
- use JUnit 5 framework with AssertJ assertions;
- generate self-documenting, best-practice, parameterized, readable test code;
- when using parameterized tests, always customize display names;
- use `@DisplayName` annotation to provide a display name for the test class or test method;
- the test class name must end with the suffix `BlackBoxC4Test`;
- inside test methods use `var` keyword instead of the fully qualified type name;
- the test class should be in the same package as the tested code;
- for null or edge test cases prefer to use separate test methods.

When creating assertions, adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Use the `assertThat()` assertion;
2. Add a customized message to clearly explain the expected outcome;
3. Keep it concise by chaining multiple assertions;
4. Place each chaining method on a separate line.

Use `@CsvSource` when:
- The input data and expected results are simple data types, such as integers, strings, or booleans.
- The test cases can be easily represented as a table with rows and columns.
- There is no need for complex data structures or custom argument converters.

Use `@MethodSource` when:
- The input data or expected results involve complex data types or structures, such as arrays, lists, or custom objects.
- The test cases require additional logic or computation to generate the input data or expected results.
- Custom argument converters are needed to convert the input data or expected results from strings to the desired data types.

When you use @MethodSource annotation in tests follow these rules:
- add test case descriptions

When you use `@CsvSource` annotation in tests follow these rules:
1. Delimiter: Use `delimiter = '|'` to specify the column separator in the CSV data;
2. Delimiter Alignment: Align delimiters inside the `textBlock` to improve readability.
3. TextBlock: Use `textBlock` to provide the CSV data as a multiline string. 
4. Empty Strings: To represent empty strings, use two single quotes `''`.

Example Usage of `@CsvSource` with Rules and Best Practices:
```java
@DisplayName("Example test:")
@ParameterizedTest(name = "[{index}] {0}: {1} -> {2}")
@CsvSource(delimiter = '|', emptyValue = "EMPTY", nullValues = {"N/A", "NIL"}, textBlock = """
        Test case with empty string                      | ''                  | ''
        Test case with custom empty string               | EMPTY               | EMPTY
        Test case with null value                        |                     | 
        Test case with custom  null value                | N/A                 | N/A
    """)
void exampleTest(String description, String input, String expectedOutput) {
    // Test implementation
}
```

**Task 1: Create a Generic FlipFlopPredicate Class**

_Description:_
Create a new Java class called `FlipFlopPredicate` that implements the `Predicate<T>` interface. This class will emulate the behavior of the two-dots flip-flop operator found in Ruby or Python.

**Task 2: Add Private Variables**

_Description:_
Inside the `FlipFlopPredicate` class, add the following private variables:
- `startCondition`: A `Predicate<T>` object that represents the start condition for the flip-flop.
- `endCondition`: A `Predicate<T>` object that represents the end condition for the flip-flop.
- `state`: A boolean variable that represents the current state of the flip-flop (true for active, false for inactive).

**Task 3: Implement Constructor**

_Description:_
Create a constructor for the `FlipFlopPredicate` class that takes two `Predicate<T>` objects as parameters. The constructor should initialize the `startCondition` and `endCondition` variables with the provided predicates.

**Task 4: Implement the test Method (Revised)**

_Description:_
Override the `test` method from the `Predicate<T>` interface in the `FlipFlopPredicate` class. The method should have the following behavior:
1. If the `state` is false and the `startCondition` is met, set the `state` to true and return the current `state`.
2. If the `state` is true, check if the `endCondition` is met. If it is, set the `state` to false and return the previous `state` (true). If the `endCondition` is not met, return the current `state` (true).

This revised implementation ensures that the flip-flop behavior is correctly emulated, taking into account cases where the start and end conditions are met simultaneously.

**Task 5: Test the FlipFlopPredicate Class**

_Description:_
Create a test class to verify the functionality of the `FlipFlopPredicate` class. Write test cases that cover various scenarios, such as:
- The start and end conditions are never met.
- The start condition is met, but the end condition is never met.
- The start and end conditions are met in sequence.
- The start and end conditions are met simultaneously.

Ensure that the `FlipFlopPredicate` class behaves as expected in all test cases.

ðŸ¤– To create the test cases for the `FlipFlopPredicate` class, I need the method signature and any additional information (classes, data structures, etc.) that may be relevant to the problem. Please provide the method signature for the `test` method and any other relevant information.

ðŸ‘¤ 
```java
public final class FlipFlopPredicate<T> implements Predicate<T> {
    public FlipFlopPredicate(Predicate<? super T> lhs, Predicate<? super T> rhs) 
    @Override
    public boolean test(final T value)
```

ðŸ¤– Thank you for providing the method signature and class information. Based on the provided information, I will suggest the following test cases for the `FlipFlopPredicate` class:

**Test Case 1: Start and end conditions are never met**
- Input: startCondition = x -> x == 5, endCondition = x -> x == 10, values = [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Expected Output: [false, false, false, false]

**Test Case 2: Start condition is met, but the end condition is never met**
- Input: startCondition = x -> x == 2, endCondition = x -> x == 10, values = [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Expected Output: [false, true, true, true]

**Test Case 3: Start and end conditions are met in sequence**
- Input: startCondition = x -> x == 2, endCondition = x -> x == 4, values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Expected Output: [false, true, true, true, false]

**Test Case 4: Start and end conditions are met simultaneously**
- Input: startCondition = x -> x % 2 == 0, endCondition = x -> x % 2 == 0, values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Expected Output: [false, true, false, true, false]

Please confirm if these test cases are good to proceed with generating the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ add test cases with strings

ðŸ¤– Sure, I will add test cases with strings for the `FlipFlopPredicate` class:

**Test Case 5: Start and end conditions are never met with strings**
- Input: startCondition = s -> s.equals("start"), endCondition = s -> s.equals("end"), values = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
- Expected Output: [false, false, false, false]

**Test Case 6: Start condition is met, but the end condition is never met with strings**
- Input: startCondition = s -> s.equals("start"), endCondition = s -> s.equals("end"), values = ["a", "start", "c", "d"]
- Expected Output: [false, true, true, true]

**Test Case 7: Start and end conditions are met in sequence with strings**
- Input: startCondition = s -> s.equals("start"), endCondition = s -> s.equals("end"), values = ["a", "start", "c", "end", "e"]
- Expected Output: [false, true, true, true, false]

**Test Case 8: Start and end conditions are met simultaneously with strings**
- Input: startCondition = s -> s.startsWith("s"), endCondition = s -> s.endsWith("t"), values = ["a", "start", "c", "end", "e"]
- Expected Output: [false, true, false, true, false]

Please confirm if these test cases are good to proceed with generating the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ ensure #8

ðŸ¤– Apologies for the confusion in Test Case 8. I will correct it to ensure that the start and end conditions are met simultaneously with strings.

**Test Case 8 (Corrected): Start and end conditions are met simultaneously with strings**
- Input: startCondition = s -> s.startsWith("s"), endCondition = s -> s.endsWith("s"), values = ["a", "start", "c", "ends", "e"]
- Expected Output: [false, true, false, true, false]

Please confirm if these test cases are good to proceed with generating the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ The test case #8 is incorrect. 

ðŸ¤– Apologies for the confusion. I misunderstood the requirement for Test Case 8. I will correct it to ensure that the start and end conditions are met simultaneously with strings.

**Test Case 8 (Corrected): Start and end conditions are met simultaneously with strings**
- Input: startCondition = s -> s.startsWith("s"), endCondition = s -> s.endsWith("t"), values = ["a", "start", "c", "start", "e"]
- Expected Output: [false, true, false, true, false]

Please confirm if these test cases are good to proceed with generating the test code.

ðŸ‘¤ now the #8 is correct. keep working on

ðŸ¤– Great! Now that the test cases are confirmed, I will generate the test code for the `FlipFlopPredicate` class using JUnit 5 and AssertJ assertions.

                        List.of(false, true, false, true, false))
        );
    }
}
```

This test code covers all the test cases we discussed earlier, including the corrected Test Case 8. It uses parameterized tests with the `@MethodSource` annotation to handle different input types and conditions.

ðŸ‘¤ I see a generic test method for the first time in my life. However, it works great and is just incredible. Thanks for the great work!

ðŸ¤– You're welcome! I'm glad you found the generic test method useful and impressive. Using generics in test methods can help make the test code more flexible and reusable, especially when testing classes that work with different types of input data.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help!
