## The AI Conversation Log

ðŸ‘¤ Hi!

ðŸ¤– Hello Jegors! How can I help you with your site today?

ðŸ‘¤ What is your name?

ðŸ¤– My name is Mike. I'm here to help you with your DevOps and site configuration needs. Let me know if you have any questions or need assistance with GitHub, GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions, Jekyll, or the Chirpy Jekyll Theme.

ðŸ‘¤ Please tell me what options exist for adding comment functionality to my site?

ðŸ¤– In your current `_config.yml` file, you have three options for adding comment functionality to your site:

1. Disqus
2. Utterances
3. Giscus

To enable one of these options, you need to set the `active` field under the `comments` section in your `_config.yml` file to the desired option. Currently, it is set to `giscus`.

Here's a brief overview of each option:

1. **Disqus**: A popular third-party commenting system that is easy to integrate with Jekyll. To use Disqus, you need to sign up for an account and get a shortname. Update the `disqus.shortname` field in your `_config.yml` file with your Disqus shortname. More information can be found in the [Disqus documentation](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717111-what-s-a-shortname).

2. **Utterances**: A lightweight commenting system built on GitHub issues. To use Utterances, you need to have a public GitHub repository and configure the `utterances.repo` field in your `_config.yml` file with your GitHub username and repository name (e.g., `username/repo`). More information can be found in the [Utterances documentation](https://utteranc.es/).

3. **Giscus**: Another lightweight commenting system built on GitHub Discussions. To use Giscus, you need to enable GitHub Discussions in your repository and configure the `giscus.repo`, `giscus.repo_id`, `giscus.category`, and `giscus.category_id` fields in your `_config.yml` file. More information can be found in the [Giscus documentation](https://giscus.app/).

Remember to commit and push your changes to the `_config.yml` file after updating the comment settings.

ðŸ‘¤ please provide a comparison of the first and second option

ðŸ¤– Sure, here's a comparison between Disqus and Utterances as commenting systems for your Jekyll site:

**Disqus**:

- Pros:
  - Popular and widely used, with a large user base.
  - Feature-rich, including moderation tools, spam filtering, and analytics.
  - Supports social login and guest commenting.
  - Easy to integrate with Jekyll and other platforms.

- Cons:
  - Third-party service, which means your comments are stored on Disqus servers.
  - May display ads or track user data, which could raise privacy concerns.
  - Can be slower to load compared to lightweight alternatives like Utterances.

**Utterances**:

- Pros:
  - Lightweight and fast-loading, with minimal impact on your site's performance.
  - Built on GitHub issues, which means your comments are stored in your GitHub repository.
  - No ads or tracking, offering better privacy for your users.
  - Open-source and easy to integrate with Jekyll.

- Cons:
  - Less feature-rich compared to Disqus, with limited moderation tools and no built-in spam filtering.
  - Requires users to have a GitHub account to comment.
  - May not be suitable for non-technical users or those unfamiliar with GitHub.

In summary, if you prefer a feature-rich commenting system with social login support and don't mind using a third-party service, Disqus might be a better choice. On the other hand, if you value privacy, performance, and open-source solutions, Utterances could be a more suitable option.

- Pros:
  - Lightweight and fast-loading, similar to Utterances.
  - Built on GitHub Discussions, which offers a more organized and feature-rich platform for conversations compared to GitHub issues.

On the other hand, if you're comfortable with using GitHub issues for comments and don't need the additional features provided by GitHub Discussions, Utterances could be a suitable option.

This table should give you a clear overview of the differences between Disqus, Utterances, and Giscus, helping you decide which commenting system best suits your needs.

ðŸ‘¤ The audience of the site is technical specialists familiar with GitHub. Which of the options is the most suitable in my case?

ðŸ¤– Considering that your audience consists of technical specialists familiar with GitHub, both Utterances and Giscus would be suitable options for your site. Both of these commenting systems are lightweight, open-source, and privacy-focused, and they integrate well with GitHub.

Between Utterances and Giscus, the main difference is that Utterances uses GitHub Issues for comments, while Giscus uses GitHub Discussions. Since GitHub Discussions offers a more organized and feature-rich platform for conversations, including markdown support, reactions, and threaded conversations, Giscus might be a better choice for your site.

To enable Giscus, you can keep the `active` field under the `comments` section in your `_config.yml` file set to `giscus`. Make sure you have properly configured the `giscus.repo`, `giscus.repo_id`, `giscus.category`, and `giscus.category_id` fields as well.

ðŸ‘¤ Thanks for your support and have a nice day!

ðŸ¤– You're welcome, Jegors! If you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, feel free to ask. Have a great day!
