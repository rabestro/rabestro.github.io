>  We need to implement FlipFlopPredicate which emulates the behavior of the two-dots flip-flop operator in Ruby or Python. The predicate should be generic and implement the `Predicate` interface.

Task 1: Create a Generic FlipFlopPredicate Class

Description:
Create a new Java class called `FlipFlopPredicate` that implements the `Predicate<T>` interface. This class will emulate the behavior of the two-dots flip-flop operator found in Ruby or Python.

Task 2: Add Private Variables

Description:
Inside the `FlipFlopPredicate` class, add the following private variables:
- `startCondition`: A `Predicate<T>` object that represents the start condition for the flip-flop.
- `endCondition`: A `Predicate<T>` object that represents the end condition for the flip-flop.
- `state`: A boolean variable that represents the current state of the flip-flop (true for active, false for inactive).

Task 3: Implement Constructor

Description:
Create a constructor for the `FlipFlopPredicate` class that takes two `Predicate<T>` objects as parameters. The constructor should initialize the `startCondition` and `endCondition` variables with the provided predicates.

Task 4: Implement the test Method

Description:
Override the `test` method from the `Predicate<T>` interface in the `FlipFlopPredicate` class. The method should have the following behavior:
1. If the `state` is false and the `startCondition` is met, set the `state` to true.
2. If the `state` is true and the `endCondition` is met, set the `state` to false.
3. Return the current `state`.

Task 5: Test the FlipFlopPredicate Class

Description:
Create a test class to verify the functionality of the `FlipFlopPredicate` class. Write test cases that cover various scenarios, such as:
- The start and end conditions are never met.
- The start condition is met, but the end condition is never met.
- The start and end conditions are met in sequence.
- The start and end conditions are met simultaneously.

Ensure that the `FlipFlopPredicate` class behaves as expected in all test cases.

ðŸ¤– Task 4: Implement the test Method (Revised)

Description:
Override the `test` method from the `Predicate<T>` interface in the `FlipFlopPredicate` class. The method should have the following behavior:
1. If the `state` is false and the `startCondition` is met, set the `state` to true and return the current `state`.
2. If the `state` is true, check if the `endCondition` is met. If it is, set the `state` to false and return the previous `state` (true). If the `endCondition` is not met, return the current `state` (true).

This revised implementation ensures that the flip-flop behavior is correctly emulated, taking into account cases where the start and end conditions are met simultaneously.
